## User Stories

I developed Keepr as much for myself as for anyone else, so my primary user that I kept in mind during the development process was, well, me! I thought about what I would want from an app like this, as well as asking friends of mine what they would like to see.  I came up with the following list of key features that helped drive my development process:

As a user I want to...
    - Be able to create a ‘list’ of type of things I want to store (books/movies/beer)

    - Quickly add items to that list

    - View my lists

    - Comment on things I add

    - Mark things as ‘tried'

    - Share my lists / items

    - View ‘tried’ items

    - Have a ‘must try’ list with my want to tries
